This C program controls a sequence of 10 LEDs on a shield using an ATmega328P microcontroller, advancing the running light through button presses. Each press moves the light by exactly one LED. Button debouncing ensures stable input, preventing unintended changes due to bouncing, with Button1 dedicated to this task. Timer/Counter0 generates 1 kHz interrupts, and debouncing is achieved by requiring a stable button press for at least 20ms.
