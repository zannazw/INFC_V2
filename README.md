This C program controls a sequence of 10 LEDs on a shield using an ATmega328P microcontroller, creating a running light effect where the LED running light is manually advanced through button presses.
Each button press should advance the running light by exactly one LED. 
The program includes functionality to debounce the buttons, preventing unintended LED changes due to button bouncing. Button1 is used for this purpose. 
Timer/Counter0 is configured to trigger interrupts at a frequency of approximately 1000 times per second.
Button debouncing is implemented by ensuring that the button is pressed for a minimum of 20ms to ensure it is in a stable state.
